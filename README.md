What is the Problem?

Many students fail real interviews not because they lack knowledge, but because they do not get realistic interview practice. Traditional mock interviews are manual, inconsistent, and do not provide clear scores, time-based evaluation, or structured feedback. As a result, students do not know how ready they are for real interviews.

What is the Solution?

The solution is an AI-powered mock interview platform that behaves like a real interviewer. It uses AI to analyze the candidate’s resume and job description, ask relevant interview questions, adjust difficulty based on performance, manage time limits, and provide objective scoring and feedback at the end.

How It Works (Steps)

The candidate uploads their resume and provides the job description.

The system analyzes skills, experience, and job requirements.

The AI interviewer asks interview questions starting from easy to hard.

The difficulty of questions changes based on how well the candidate answers.

Each question has a fixed time limit to simulate real interview pressure.

Answers are evaluated based on clarity, relevance, accuracy, and time taken.

At the end, the system generates an interview readiness score, strengths, weaknesses, and improvement suggestions.
